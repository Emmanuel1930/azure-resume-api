Creating Azure Cosmos DB Serverless API for Storing Data in Table Format
When setting up an Azure Cosmos DB serverless API to store data in a table format, it's crucial to understand the intricacies involved, including defining the partition key, managing the ID field, and handling metadata. Here's a comprehensive guide to navigate through these aspects effectively.

Setting Up Azure Cosmos DB
Creating an Azure Cosmos DB Account:

Begin by creating a new Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal.
Choose the appropriate API (such as SQL API) that supports storing data in JSON format.
Understanding the Partition Key:

The partition key in Cosmos DB determines how data is distributed across physical partitions.
Choose a property that has a high cardinality and is frequently used in queries to ensure optimal performance.
Defining the ID Field:

Each document in Cosmos DB must have a unique identifier (id field).
It's essential to manage the generation of this identifier to avoid conflicts and ensure uniqueness across your dataset.
Storing Data in Table Format
Creating a JSON Schema:

Define a structured JSON schema that represents your data model, including nested objects and arrays as needed.
